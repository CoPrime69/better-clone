        How to calculate monthly mortgage payments?
      </h2>

      <p className="font-normal leading-body m-0 p-0 text-left text-textPrimary text-base">
        Your monthly mortgage payment includes loan principal and interest,
        property taxes, homeowners insurance, and mortgage insurance (PMI), if
        applicable. While not typically included in your mortgage payment,
        homeowners also pay monthly utilities and sometimes pay homeowners
        association (HOA) fees, so it's a good idea to factor these into your
        monthly budget. This mortgage calculator factors in all these typical
        monthly costs so you can really crunch the numbers.

        Here's an interesting fact: Once you fully own your home, the choice to
        maintain homeowners insurance is entirely up to you. However, to ensure
        your home is protected against damages caused by fires, lightning
        strikes, and natural disasters that are common in your area, it is
        highly recommended to keep it. Therefore, always factor in these costs
        when using a Mortgage Calculator.

        This mortgage calculator shows your mortgage costs with PMI
      </h3>

      <p className="font-normal leading-body m-0 p-0 text-left text-textPrimary text-base">
        PMI, an abbreviation for private mortgage insurance, aids potential
        homeowners in qualifying for a mortgage without the necessity of a 20%
        down payment. By opting for a lower down payment and choosing a mortgage
        with PMI, you can purchase a home sooner, begin accruing equity, and
        keep cash available for future needs. This can all be calculated using
        this Mortgage Calculator.

        PMI is automatically removed from conventional mortgages once your home
        equity reaches 22%. Alternatively, you can request the removal of PMI
        once you've accumulated at least 20% home equity.

        This mortgage calculator includes HOA fees
      </h3>

      <p className="font-normal leading-body m-0 p-0 text-left text-textPrimary text-base">
        Homeowners association ("HOA") fees are typically charged directly by a
        homeowners association, but as HOA fees come part and parcel with
        condos, townhomes, and planned housing developments, they're an
        essential factor to consider when calculating your mortgage costs.
      </p>

      <p className="font-normal leading-body m-0 p-0 text-left text-textPrimary text-base">
        Homes that share structural elements, such as roofs and walls, or
        community amenities like landscaping, pools, or BBQ areas, often require
        homeowners to pay HOA fees for the maintenance of these shared features.
        It's important to factor in these costs during your budget planning
        stage, especially considering that HOA fees typically increase annually.
        HOAs may also charge additional fees known as 'special assessments' to
        cover unexpected expenses from time to time.

        The lower the purchase price of the home, the lower your loan amount

      </h3>

      <p className="font-normal leading-body m-0 p-0 text-left text-textPrimary text-base">
        The more time you have to pay off the mortgage, the less each monthly
        mortgage payment will be. (In lender-speak, 'extending the length of
        your mortgage' is known as 'increasing your loan term'.) This is why
        people often choose a 30-year fixed rate mortgage over one with a 15- or
        20-year term.

        can't afford a complete 20% down payment, boosting your down payment
        will help you get PMI removed sooner. In fact, boosting your down
        payment by 5% can lower your monthly PMI fees.
